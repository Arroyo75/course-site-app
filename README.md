A project for an app that allows users to create their own courses and enroll on courses of other users. I made this app to get a better grasp of web technologies - the MERN full stack.
Technologies:
Backend - Node.js Express MongoDb Multer ( for file uploads )
Frontend - React.js Vite ChakraUI

Project will include file uploading and downloading, with aws s3 storage. ( not yet implemented )

How to run:
Right now site isn't hosted anywhere if you want to check out the project clone repo, then:
npm run build (to install dependencies)
npm run start (to start backend server)
cd frontend
npm run dev (to run frontend)

all the dependencies as well as scripts are listed in package.json
